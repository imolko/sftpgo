## Dockerfile examples

Sample Dockerfiles for `sftpgo` daemon and the REST API CLI.

We don't want to add a `Dockerfile` for each single `sftpgo` configuration options or data provider. You can use the docker configurations here as starting point that you can customize to run `sftpgo` with [Docker](http://www.docker.io "Docker").
